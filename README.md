Hi, I’m Lucia\
I’m a Data Analytics student currently pursuing a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing (Data Analytics) at Atlantic Technological University. I have background in environmental science, international work experience, and now I am focused on building practical, data‑driven solutions.\
I enjoy working with real‑world data, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into clean, functional code
